## Question 1
Assume that `PC=07FFh` and the memory contents are as below table:

| Address | Content |
| ------: | :------ |
| `07FFh` | `EA9Fh` |
| `0A9Fh` | `0C35h` |
| `0C35h` | `FFFFh` |

Suppose the instruction code for ISZ (Increment and Skip if Zero) is `1110b`.

**NOTE:** RTL for ISZ is as follow:
```js
DR ← M [AR]
DR ← DR + 1
M[AR] ← DR, if (DR = 0) then (PC ← PC + 1), SC ← 0
```

`AR= "Address Register"`
`SR= "Sequence counter/Register"`
`DR= "Data Register"`
`M[]= "Memory access"`

What will be changed in the memory and what the values will be (if yes)?

<blockquote>

```js
DR ← M[AR]          // AR = A9F, M[AR] = C35
DR ← DR + 1         // C35 + 1 = C36
M[AR] ← DR          // M[A9F] = C36
    if (DR = 0)     // C36 == 0 -> false
        PC ← PC + 1 // Never hit, so increment doesn't happen
    SC ← 0
```
Yes, there will be changes in the values in memory after execution of this. As we can see here, the value at memory address `A9F` will be changed from `C35` to `C36`.

## Question 2
Suppose we have a hard disk drive and its specifications are as follow:
- Number of platters = 10
- Each platter has two surfaces.
- Each surface has 50K tracks.
- Each track has 1k sectors averagely.
- Size of each sector is 2KB.
- Rotational rate= 7200 RPM
- Average seek time=10 millisecond
- The disk read-speed is 64 Megabytes per second.
- Controller overhead is 0.1 millisecond.

#### a) What is disk capacity?
```js
let k = sector size in KB,
    s = sectors in track,
    t = tracks in surface,
    f = surfaces in platter,
    p = number of platters,

capacity = p * f * t * s * k
         = 2 * 1000 * 50,000 * 2 * 10
         = 2000 * 100,000 * 10
         = 200,000,000 * 10
         = 2,000,000,000KB
         = 2,000Gb
```

#### b) What is the average access time?
```js
let rr = rotational rate,
    st = Seek time
    rs = Read speed
    co = Controller overhead
    rd = rotational delay

rd = 1 / (rr / 60) * 0.5 * 1000
   = 1 / (7200 / 60) * 500
   = 500 / (120)
   = 4.16ms

access time = st + rd + co
            = 10 + 4.16 + 0.1
            = 14.26ms
```

## Question 3
Assume we have a 5GHz processor that is running a program with $5×10^9$ instructions out of which $20\%$ is branch, $20\%$ load, $10\%$ store, and the rest is ALU. CPI for this machine is

| Branch | Load  | Store |  ALU  |
| :----: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|   1    |  0.5  |   1   |   2   |

####a) How long does it take from the processor to run the program?
```js
ICi = number of instructions per type
CCi = number of cycles per instruction
ICT = total number of instructions being executed

       Σ[(ICi)(CCi)]
CPI = ---------------
            ICT

ICT = 5*10^9 = 5,000,000,000

// CPI for branch instructions
5,000,000,000 * 0.2 = 1,000,000,000
1,000,000,000 * 1.0 = 1,000,000,000

// Number of load instructions
5,000,000,000 * 0.2 = 1,000,000,000
1,000,000,000 * 0.5 = 500,000,000

// Number of store instructions
5,000,000,000 * 0.1 = 500,000,000
500,000,000   * 1.0 = 500,000,000

// Number of ALU instructions
5,000,000,000 - 2,500,000,000 = 2,500,000,000
2,500,000,000 * 2 = 5,000,000,000

       1,000,000,000 + 500,000,000 + 500,000,000 + 5,000,000,000
CPI = ----------------------------------------------------------- = 1.4
                            5,000,000,000
```

####b) The required time to run the code is too long and the programmer has been requested to enhance the code or propose a solution. Two solutions are available; better memory organization and using a new instruction. The former solution improves the average CPI from $0.5$ to $1$ and the later solution reduce percentage of ALU usage by $20\%$ without improving CPI. Which one is better?

## Question 4

Assume we have:
- a two-way set associative cache with four words per block.
- The capacity of the cache is 2048 words.
- The size of main memory is 128K words.

What are the required bits for **tag**, **set** and **word** of the cache address?

```js
Number of blocks in cache = Capacity of cache in words / number of words in block
            = 2048 / 4
            = 512

Number of bits in set = number of blocks / associativity
            = 512 / 2
            = 256
            = 2^8
            = 8

Bits in offset = log_2(size of block)
            = log_2(4)
            = 2

Bits for tag = size of address - (bits in set + bits in offset)
            = 17 - (8 + 2)
            = 17 - 10
            = 7

             17 bits
 _______________/\_______________
/                                \
+---------|---------|------------+
| Tag = 7 | Set = 8 | Offset = 2 |
+---------|---------|------------+
```
