## Question 1

Suppose a disk drive has the following characteristics:

- 2 surfaces
- 2048 tracks per surface
- 128 sectors per track
- 4096 bytes/sector
- Track-to-track seek time of 12ms
- Rotational speed of 10,000 rpm

#### a) What is the capacity of the drive?
```js
let b = sector size in bytes,
    s = sectors in track,
    t = tracks in surface,
    f = number of surfaces

capacity = f * t * s * b
         = 2 * 2048 * 128 * 4096
         = 4096 * 524,288
         = 2,147,483,648
         = 2.147Gb
```

#### b) What is the access time?
```js
let rr = rotational rate,
    rs = Read speed
    st = Seek time
    rd = rotational delay

rd = 1 / (rr / 60) * 0.5 * 1000
   = 1 / (10000 / 60) * 500
   = 500 / (166.66)
   = 3ms

access time = st + rd
            = 10 + 3
            = 13ms
```

## Question 2
Suppose your company has decided that it needs to make certain busy servers 50% faster. Processes in the workload spend 50% of their time using CPU and 50% on I/O. In order to achieve an overall system speedup of 45%:

#### a) How much faster does the CPU need to be?

If the initial speed of the server is 100% and you need a 50% speedup, you'd need to make your server run at 100 * 1.5 = 150% speed - compared to the current speed as "100%".

If the CPU is the only thing being upgraded, then it would need to be twice as fast. 100 / 2 = 50% CPU. 50 * 2 = 100% + 50% I/O = 150%.

#### b) How much faster does the disk need to be?

The disk would be the same thing as the CPU. If they're both 50% and you need to make your servers 50% faster, then you'd need to make the I/O twice as fast.

If you're upgrading both CPU and I/O then you can upgrade both by 25% to achieve the 150% performance when baselining initial performance as 100%.
